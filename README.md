# hello-world
Newbie repository


Hello all, I am completely new to all of this wonderful coding language, but so far I am enjoying what I'm seeing and learning (albeit not much). Any and all pointers, tips, constructive criticism, basically any kind of feedback that will help me learn and become fluent in coding, is welcome and appreciated. Thanks in advance and I look forward to reading about and eventually contributing to many projects in the GitHub. -ItsBriBaby
